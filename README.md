# Sacco Milk Procurement Application System
### Introduction

The Sacco Milk Procurement Application System is a web-based platform that aims to eliminate the exploitation of rural milk farmers by middlemen. The application will enable farmers to register with milk saccos and receive fair payment for their milk produce.
Problem Statement

Many rural milk farmers are often exploited by middlemen, resulting in a loss of income. Farmers receive payment based on the quantity of milk they deliver, without consideration for the quality of the milk. The lack of direct interaction between milk Saccos and farmers further exacerbates the problem.
Main Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a web-based Sacco Milk Procurement Application System that will eliminate exploitation of farmers by middlemen.
Specific Objectives

    To identify the required modules of the Sacco milk procurement application system
    To design a milk procurement application system
    To code the designed milk procurement system
    To test the developed prototype.

## Project Specification

The Sacco Milk Procurement Application System will enable farmers to register with milk saccos and receive fair payment for their milk produce. In addition to the quantity of milk delivered, payment to milk farmers will also be processed based on the quality of milk delivered. This application will eliminate the need for middlemen and ensure that farmers receive fair payment for their milk produce.
